# Predicting-Machine-Failures-with-Machine-Learning

This project explores **predictive maintenance** using **XGBoost** and **MLP** models to predict machine failures based on sensor data.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to predict machine failures before they occur, using data from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The project demonstrates how XGBoost outperforms MLP for this task.
